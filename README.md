This repositiory is for the CSE351:Computer Networks course
The goal of this project is to design and implement a robust Peer-to-Peer Multi-User Chatting
Application using Python and sockets. The application aims to emulate features similar to popular
platforms like Clubhouse, but with a focus on text-based communication. The project will be divided
into four phases, each building on the previous one, to demonstrate proficiency in network
application protocol design, client-server and peer-to-peer architecture, and the proper use of TCP
and UDP protocols.
